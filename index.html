<p>9/9/22- We designed our first tinkercad for our rube goldberg machine, we made a domino hit a car then pop a balloon</p>

 9/16/22- We had a competion with paper boats and we had the max time

<p>10/13/22- We made paper air planes, went to the top floor of the 1000, and tried to hit a bucket</p>

<p>10/31/22- We learned how to use circuitry on Tinkercad, and we made alot of different circuits and expiremented with the voltage</p>

<p>11/10/22- We learned how to use circuits hands on, and we made LEDs light up. We also expiramented with the voltage</p>

<p>11/14/22- We learned how to code with arduinos</p>

<p>11/28/22- We got told that our final was going to be a bridge, 2 ft long made of 20 spaghettis, we then tinkercaded it</p>

<p>11/5/22- We made a bridge that was just a straight line, it worked for a little, then broke</p>

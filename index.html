<h2> Engineering Journal</h2>
 
 <p> 9/2/22- We learned how to tinkercad. We had a competion with tinkercad and I made a stove. I came im 3rd</p>

<p>9/9/22- We designed our first tinkercad for our rube goldberg machine, we made a domino fall down to hit a car,then thee car hits a pendulum that had a needle attachted to it, which then popped a balloon</p>

 9/16/22- We had a competion with paper boats, our team made a boat by folding the paper, then folding the sides in so the water wont get in as easy,and in the end, we had the max time 
 
 <p>9/23/22- We finished our rube goldberg and it works good, we popped the balloon on our 5th try or around there</p>

 <p>10/7/22- We made animal prosthetics on tinkercad and made pb&j sandwiches</p>

<p>10/13/22- We were given one piece of paper each, then told to fold,, bend, and shape the paper in any way we want to try to get it in a bucket, we then went to the top floor of the 1000 building, and tried to make the planes into the bucket</p>

<p>10/31/22- We learned how to use circuitry on Tinkercad, and we made alot of different circuits and expiremented with the voltage</p>

<p>11/10/22- We learned how to use circuits hands on, and we made LEDs light up. We also expiramented with the voltage</p>

<p>11/14/22- We learned how to code with arduinos, we logged in to the arduino website and made the lights flash, repeat, and have differnet voltages</p>

<p>11/28/22- We got told that our final was going to be a bridge, 2 ft long made of 20 spaghettis, we then tinkercaded different ideas we had for the bridge</p>

<p>12/5/22- For our first bridge, we made a bridge that was just a straight line that was covered in glue, it worked for a little,it bent more and more, then eventually broke</p>

<p>12/13/22- We made our final bridge and its very nice, its made by 3 lines of spaghetti, with smaller pieces on top, then a golden gate bridge type of suspension on top</p>

<p>12/20/22- Today was testing day, our spaghetti bridge was finally being put to the test. Everyone elses bridge held up quite good, but ours on the other hand, didnt. A teammate thought it was a good idea to hang the bucket from the center of our bridge, even though I told him not to, the second the bucket was placed, even without water, our bridge snapped into pieces</p>
